# SofToss Video

This directory contains a short summary video related to the paper SofToss. For all the other videos that were recorded during the experiments, please consult the following [`link`](https://alumnisssup-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/diego_bianchi_santannapisa_it/EhaO_YOc6vpKjKZeL8cQOwEBP8Uel37bEUxmQFhSO6ZnYQ?e=iUOhpY). Here you can find the interface that we developed to access the different media.

In this interface it is possible to choose one experimental trial by selecting the different variables (target position, object, actuation type, number of trial, control method and type of media that can be a video of the trial or its movement reconstruction) through the radio buttons. A pop-up will appear to show the selected trial file.
