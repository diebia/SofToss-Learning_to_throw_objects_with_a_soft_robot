Caption:,"Comparison of RL agents in object-specific direct models. Analysis of the reinforcement learning (RL) agents within the context of object-specific direct models. The performance of these agents is evaluated on the minimum, average, and maximum distances (in millimeters) of the landing positions achieved by the corresponding actuation patterns. The RL agents' policies are trained and tested using the environment built upon the object-specific direct model.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
